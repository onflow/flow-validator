# Run a Flow validator node

Are you interested in laying down the foundation for a new decentralized network?

The Flow network is comprised of different staked node types; a separation of concerns that significantly reduces redundant effort

As a result, Flow is among the most environmentally friendly Web 3 networks, with four different node types depending on hardware capacity, internet speed, and stake: 

- Consensus Nodes decide the presence and order of transactions on the blockchain

- Collection Nodes enhance network connectivity and data availability for dapps

- Execution Nodes perform the computation associated with each transaction

- Verification Nodes are responsible for keeping the Execution Nodes in check

The different types of nodes are described more in-depth [here](https://developers.flow.com/networks/node-ops/node-operation/node-roles).
As node operator, you can choose to run any of the different types of node that best fits your needs. For more see [here](https://developers.flow.com/networks/node-ops)

_Validator Node applications are reviewed by the Flow governance working group on a rolling basis._

## Steps to run a validator node

1. Submit an [issue](https://github.com/onflow/flow-node-operation/issues) on this repository.
   
2. The Flow governance working group will review the submission on a weekly basis.
   
3. Once approved, you can follow the [node bootstrapping guide](https://developers.flow.com/networks/node-ops/node-operation/node-bootstrap)
